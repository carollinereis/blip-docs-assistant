## Overview
The **Blip Docs Assistant** is a full-stack application that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer questions based on technical documentation. It uses a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture to ensure accurate and context-aware responses.

## Architecture
To align with the requirements of high-performance engineering teams, the project is structured as follows:

* **AI Engine (Python):** Powered by FastAPI and LangChain for PDF processing, embeddings generation, and LLM orchestration.
* **Middleware (C# / .NET):** An ASP.NET Core API acting as a secure gateway and business logic orchestrator.
* **Frontend (React + TypeScript):** A modern, responsive chat interface built with Vite.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Languages:** Python 3.11+, C# (ASP.NET Core), TypeScript.
* **AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4o, LangChain, FAISS/Azure AI Search.
* **Web:** React.js, Vite, TailwindCSS.
* **DevOps:** GitHub Projects (Agile/Kanban), Git.
